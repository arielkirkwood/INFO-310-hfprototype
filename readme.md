This repo is a set of HTML/CSS/JS prototypes I created for my INFO 310 Human-Computer Interaction II group project during my Winter 2012 term at Drexel.

The project was to do a set of prototypes for a new vital signs monitoring system.

Demo available here: http://neonelectro.github.com/INFO-310-hfprototype/

Used in the project:

* Twitter Bootstrap (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
* sparklines.js (http://willarson.com/code/sparklines/sparklines.html)
